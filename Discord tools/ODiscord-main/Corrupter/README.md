## How does ODiscord Corrupter works
Once the file is runned, the file will will rewrite discord app.asar(Core/Whatever) "C:\Users\Nukrws\AppData\Local\Discord\app-1.0.9002\resources\app.asar" to ":P" which lead to javascript error. The only way to fix this is If you backup your computer files find the app.asar in AppData Local Discord and replace it or reinstall discord.
